# Introduction

The following shows in chronological order how I went about completing this technical challenge, and how long each task took.

# Initial Setup

The intial set up of the Symfony project took 30 minutes


# Unit tests

I completed this task using Test Driven Development, so I created all of the unit tests for my 'CheckerService' methods first and made sure all tests were intitially failing. This took me 30 minutes.


# Core functionality

The next step was to add the functionality to my 'CheckerService' methods and make sure the unit tests now all passed. This took me 30 minutes.


# Refactoring

I noticed some areas in which the main functionality could be improved, for example moving repeated code into a 'cleanString' method. This took 10 minutes.

# Extra Tasks

I then completed some extra tasks as explained in detail in the 'instructions.md' file. To create the functionality and styling for this it took me 60 minutes. 

To add the additional tests for my controller in took me an additional 30 minutes.
